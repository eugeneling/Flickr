# flickr Home Page
Flickrâ€™s home page is one of the most elegant and simple homepages that I have seen, so I decided to clone it. This is my first webpage that I have ever cloned and I have learned a lot from this project. Some of the biggest takeaways were:

1. The importance of BEM naming convention: Prior to using BEM naming convention, my CSS code was extremely difficult to read, let alone maintain. BEM naming convention provided structure and modularity to my code. This allowed me to clearly target HTML elements and quickly make design changes.

2. Responsive and mobile friendly design: I learned the importance of flexboxes, which makes it easy to change rows into columns, making the website much easier to navigate on a mobile device. In addition, I also learned that I needed to set dynamic heights (and minimum height) for my website to look better on larger screens.

3. The value of background images: Background images has a whole host of properties, such as background-position and background-image, that makes it incredibly easy to fit background pictures into containers and make them responsive.
